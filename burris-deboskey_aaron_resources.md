## List of Resources

I have found the following resources to be quite helpful in the beginning of my coding journey:

* Codecademy.com has been awesome for reinforcing concepts, and providing hands-on applications to practice.
* Keybr.com and Typing.io have been great typing practice. I try to spend some time with each site every day.
* [This article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows) on atlassian.com has ben helpful for understanding git workflows.
* MDN and Stack Overflow have been great for defining new terms and concepts.
* Slack, and fellow Mod 0 students have also been one of the most valuable resources so far.
