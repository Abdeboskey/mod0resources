# Variable Theory

A thought I just had (not sure how 100% correct this is but): Maybe we can think of classes like a category of variables that store data about an instance of that `class`. `Attributes` are variables that are stored inside the `class` variable, that contain the different types of data that make up/define a `class`. `Methods` are like other variables that contain programs, that alter the data stored inside those variables assigned to instances (kinds of variables) of a `class`! Methods are designed to locate specific kinds of classes, and operate on the data stored in that specific `class`! It's all just **variables** that affect **variables** stored inside of other **variables**! It's variables all the way up!

  * does this make sense or am I just rambling about variables? (I think this makes sense).
