A thought I just had (not sure how 100% correct this is but): Maybe we can think of classes like a category of variables that store data about an instance of that .  are variables that are stored inside the  variable, that contain the different types of data that make up/defnine a .   are like other variables that contain programs, that alter the data stored inside those variables assigned to instances (kinds of variables) of a ! Methods are designed to locate specific kinds of classes, and operate on the data stored in that specific class! It's all just **variables** that affect **variables** stored inside of other **variables**! It's variables all the way up!

does this make sense or am I just rambling about variables?

Attributes are variables that are stored inside the class variable, that contain the different types of data that make up/defnine a class.  Methods are like other variables that contain programs, that alter the data stored inside those variables assigned to instances (kinds of variables) of a class! Methods are designed to locate specific kinds of classes, and operate on the data stored in that specific class! It's all just variables that affect variables stored inside of other variables!
